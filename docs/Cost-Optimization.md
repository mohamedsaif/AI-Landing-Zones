## Cost Optimization

| ID    | Specification |
|-------|--------------|
| CO-R1 | **Costing & Pricing**: The AI Landing Zone must provide clear guidance on the cost of deploying it and follow best practices for planning and managing cost in [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/costs-plan-manage), [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/manage-costs), and [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-plan-manage-cost). |
| CO-R2 | **PTU & PAYGO Endpoints**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance and implementation of AOAI with two endpoints, one with PTU and one with PAYGO setup.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>If you have predictable workloads, use AI commitment tiers in Azure AI services. For Azure OpenAI models, use [provisioned throughput units](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/provisioned-throughput) (PTUs), which can be less expensive than pay-as-you-go (consumption-based) pricing. It's common to combine PTU endpoints and consumption-based endpoints for cost optimization. Use PTUs on the AI model primary endpoint and a secondary, consumption-based AI endpoint for spillover. For more information, see [Introduce a gateway for multiple Azure OpenAI instances](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/azure-openai-gateway-multi-backend#multiple-azure-openai-instances-in-a-single-region-and-single-subscription). |
| CO-R3 | **Deployment Type**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance and implementation of various AOAI deployment types in particular the global deployment type.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Azure OpenAI models allow you to use different [deployment types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/deployment-types). Global deployment offers lower cost-per-token pricing on certain OpenAI models. |
| CO-R4 | **Service Selection**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance on service selection based on cost and performance.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Choose the right hosting infrastructure, depending on your solution's needs. For example, for generative AI workloads, options include managed online endpoints, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure App Service, each with its own billing model. Select the option that provides the best balance between performance and cost for your specific requirements. |
| CO-R5 | **Auto-shutdown**: Implement auto shutdown policy for compute resources in non-prod implementation.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Define and enforce a policy stating that AI resources must use the automatic shutdown feature on virtual machines and compute instances in Azure AI Foundry and Azure Machine Learning. Automatic shutdown is applicable to nonproduction environments and production workloads that you can take offline for certain periods of time. |
