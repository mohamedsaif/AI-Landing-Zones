## Monitoring

| ID   | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| M-R1 | The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance and setup to monitor [AI models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/platform/management#manage-ai-models), [AI resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/platform/management#manage-ai-operations), [AI data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/platform/management#manage-ai-data) to ensure that it remain aligned with customer’s KPIs |
| M-R2 | **AMBA**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance and implementation of recommended alerts leveraging AMBA.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Enable recommended alert rules to receive notifications of deviations that indicate a decline in workload health. For examples, see [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/monitor-azure-cognitive-search#azure-ai-search-alert-rules), [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/monitor-azure-machine-learning), [Azure AI Foundry prompt flow deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/monitor-quality-safety?tabs=azure-studio), and guidance on individual Azure AI services. |
| M-R3 | **Monitor generative AI:** The AI Landing should provide guidance on how to monitor the performance of a generative AI application that leverages the AI landing zone<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>For generative AI workloads, use Azure AI Foundry's built-in [evaluation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in) and [manual](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-prompts-playground) monitoring capabilities. If you're using prompt flow, [monitor prompt flow deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/trace-production-sdk). Also consider using [responsible AI tools](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox#introducing-responsible-ai-dashboard) to supplement model monitoring. |
| M-R4 | **Monitor nongenerative AI:** The AI Landing should provide guidance on how to monitor the performance of a nongenerative AI application that leverages the AI landing zone<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>For nongenerative AI workloads, monitor data processing stages and model performance metrics to ensure predictions remain accurate and reliable. Enable [model monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-model-monitoring) in Azure Machine Learning. For Azure AI services, enable monitoring for each AI service you use. |
| M-R5 | **Monitor generative AI performance:** The AI Landing should provide guidance on how to monitor the performance of a generative AI application that leverages the AI landing zone<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>In generative AI, monitor latency in response times or the accuracy of vector search results to enhance user experiences. In Azure AI Foundry, [enable tracing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/trace-local-sdk) to collect trace data for each request, aggregated metrics, and user feedback. |
| M-R6 | **Monitor nongenerative AI performance:** The AI Landing should provide guidance on how to monitor the performance of a non-generative AI application that leverages the AI landing zone<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Capture [performance metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-monitor-model-performance#set-up-model-performance-monitoring) of models deployed in Azure Machine Learning. For Azure AI services, enable [diagnostic logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/diagnostic-logging) for each Azure AI service. |
| M-R7 | **Monitor platform resources:** The AI Landing Zone should have diagnostic settings configured to capture logs and metrics of all deployed resources to a log analytics workspace.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Use diagnostic settings to capture logs and metrics for all key services, such as Azure AI Foundry, [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/monitor-azure-machine-learning), and [Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/diagnostic-logging). Specific services should capture audit logs and relevant service-specific logs. Implement custom monitoring alerts based on your architecture’s specific needs. Examples include alerts for container registries, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure OpenAI. Configure recommended monitoring alerts for each service in your AI architecture. For more information, see [Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/patterns/artificial-intelligence/) |
| M-R8 | **Monitor model & data drift:** The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance on how to monitor model & data drift.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Track accuracy and data drift continuously in generative and nongenerative AI to ensure that models remain relevant. Monitoring can alert you when model predictions or large language model responses deviate from expected behavior. This deviation indicates a need for retraining or adjustment. Set up custom alerts to detect performance thresholds. This approach enables early intervention when problems arise. Use [evaluations in Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-approach-gen-ai) and [metrics supported in Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-model-monitoring). |
| M-R9 | The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance on how to leverage Azure Monitor insights and Azure network watcher for trouble shooting networking issues.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Use services such as Azure Monitor Network Insights and Azure Network Watcher to gain visibility into network performance and health. |
